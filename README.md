clgl is a simple, REPL-based graphics library that uses OpenGL for rendering and [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) for windowing.

The goal of this project is to give me a simple to use OpenGL canvas that I can interact with from [Slime](https://github.com/slime/slime).

The primary use case is to have a CLGL window with various graphical objects open on one half of my screen, while I interact with them from Emacs on the other half of the screen.

It's also possible to use CLGL as a library in other applications.
